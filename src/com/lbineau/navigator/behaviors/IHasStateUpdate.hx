	 * Pseudo code example:
	 * 		
	 * 	navigator.add(this, "/gallery/", NavigationBehavior.UPDATE);
	 * 	
	 * 	then the state is updated to "/gallery/categoryA/244/".
	 * 	the navigator will call update state with the following arguments:
	 * 		
	 * 		updateState("/categoryA/244/", "/gallery/categoryA/244/");
	 * 		
	 * 	and truncated.firstSegment will render you with "categoryA",
	 * 	truncated.lastSegment will give you "244".
