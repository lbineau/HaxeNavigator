 * Consider this scenario. You have two validators listening to the same state.
 * One validator cares for paths that start with "some" (like /some/path/1/ and /some/path/2/)
 * Another validator cares for paths that start with "any" (like /any/path/5/ and /any/path/6/)
 * 
 * If both were simple IHasStateValidation, they could only give feedback about "pass" (true) or "fail" (false),
 * and each of them would invalidate paths that belong to the other.
 * 
 * That's where this optional validation check comes in. If you have a case where two 
 * validators are registered to the same path, have them implement this interface.
 * 
 * Right before the actual validation, they will be asked if they want to validate the requested
 * path. If they then return false, the validate() method will not be called.
